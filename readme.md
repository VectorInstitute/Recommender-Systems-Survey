- **Abstract**:
  > Recommender Systems (RS) play an integral role in enhancing user experiences by providing
personalized item suggestions. This survey reviews the progress in RS inclusively from 2017 to 2024,
effectively connecting theoretical advances with practical applications. We explore the development
from traditional RS techniques like content-based and collaborative filtering to advanced methods
involving deep learning, graph-based models, reinforcement learning, and large language models.
We also discuss specialized systems such as context-aware, review-based, and fairness-aware RS.
The primary goal of this survey is to bridge theory with practice. It addresses challenges across
various sectors, including e-commerce, healthcare, and finance, emphasizing the need for scalable,
real-time, and trustworthy solutions. Through this survey, we promote stronger partnerships between
academic research and industry practices. The insights offered by this survey aim to guide industry
professionals in optimizing RS deployment and to inspire future research directions, especially in
addressing emerging technological and societal trends.
