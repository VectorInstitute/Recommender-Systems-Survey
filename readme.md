## üîç**Introduction**
This survey acts as a comprehensive benchmark and cookbook to determine where, when, and why specific recommender system methodologies from academia should be applied across various industry sectors. It covers advancements in recommender systems from 2017 to 2024, and includes 65 pages of in-depth analysis with over 500 references. The document features 11 comprehensive analysis tables and addresses 19 sets of recommender system techniques, ranging from traditional methods to advanced specialized AI techniques, across ten diverse sectors including e-commerce, healthcare, and finance.


## Key Contributions
1. Comprehensive review tracing the development of RS from 2017 to 2024.
2. Around 500+ high impact papers were reviewed. 
3. Thorough examination of different RS types, challenges, datasets, and metrics.
4. Emphasis on bridging theoretical advancements with real-world applications.
5. Highlights on emerging trends such as **Explainable AI**, **FATE (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Ethics)**, and **Large Language Models**.

This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the development of Recommender Systems (RS), beginning with traditional techniques such as content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid approaches. While these traditional RS have been widely implemented, they encounter significant challenges in adapting to dynamic user preferences, providing real-time recommendations, and addressing issues such as the cold start problem and data privacy. To overcome these limitations, there is a clear need for more advanced methods, particularly those involving deep learning.

In response to these challenges, the paper transitions to discussing advanced methods, including four key deep learning models such as Autoencoders. These models have substantially improved the ability to personalize recommendations and capture complex user-item interactions, resulting in enhanced performance in sectors like e-commerce, news, and entertainment. The evolution of these models has further led to the development of even more sophisticated techniques, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are capable of boosting both accuracy and diversity in recommendations. These advancements are explored in detail within the section on advanced modeling techniques.

Building on the discussion of deep learning, the paper delves into six advanced modeling techniques, including graph-based models, reinforcement learning, and large language models. Additionally, it examines six specialized RS areas, such as context-aware, review-based, and fairness-aware systems. These specialized RS are tailored to address unique user preferences and situations across various domains. Unlike general RS, these systems focus on specialized functions and targeted recommendations, utilizing advanced techniques to deliver context-aware, review-based, aspect-based, explainable, and fairness-focused recommendations.

The overarching goal of this survey is to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications in RS. By addressing challenges across ten diverse sectors, including e-commerce, healthcare, and finance, the paper emphasizes the importance of developing scalable, real-time, and trustworthy RS solutions. Furthermore, the survey highlights how these advancements are already being applied in industry settings to tackle domain-specific challenges. The insights provided are intended to guide industry professionals in optimizing RS deployment and to inspire future research, particularly in addressing the emerging technological and societal trends that will shape the future of Recommender Systems.
